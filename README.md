## Sources
Based largely on learnings from Marco Behler's course "The confident Spring professional" https://www.marcobehler.com/ which I bought for myself in order to understand the fundamentals of Spring. 
After going through the course twice trying out things on my own. Checking source code only when necessary and understanding better how everything works.
